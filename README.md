<h1>Install VirtualBox on an Apple Silicon Mac (M1 / M2 / M3)</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple steps that walks the user through how to install VirtualBox specifically optimized for M1, M2, and M3 Apple Silicon architecture. VirtualBox is virtualization software that enables you to run different operating systems in virtual containers on your Mac directly from the application; for instance, you can run Linux or Windows within VirtualBox without needing to dual-boot or use any other methods. It achieves this on your Mac by emulating hardware, so the OS thinks it is running on physical hardware, and you can adjust settings like RAM and storage as needed.
